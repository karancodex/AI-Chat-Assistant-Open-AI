🚀 AI Chat Assistant – Powered by AIMLAPI & Next.js
An AI-powered chat assistant built using Next.js and integrated with AIMLAPI (OpenAI-compatible API). This project brings conversational AI to the browser with a clean, modern UI and scalable architecture.

🧠 About the Project
This project demonstrates how to build a real-time AI assistant using:

Next.js for fast, server-rendered React apps

AIMLAPI for AI chat completions (GPT-3.5/GPT-4)

Tailwind CSS or modern UI components for styling (optional)

Scalable architecture for production-ready AI apps

Whether you're creating a chatbot, virtual assistant, or AI help desk, this template gives you a solid foundation.
